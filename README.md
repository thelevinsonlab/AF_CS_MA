# Atrial fibrillation TRanscriptional sIgnatUre Meta-analysis (ATRIUM)

Code used for performing a consensus transcriptional signature meta-analysis of atrial fibrillation (AF) from atrial tissue.

## Description

Despite advances in understanding AF pathophysiology through the lens of transcriptomics, marked differences in the key AF genes between studies remain, while drugs targeting preserved dysregulated pathways are limited. This meta-analysis aimed to provide a consensus transcriptional signature of AF and use it to identify potentially repurposable drugs.
